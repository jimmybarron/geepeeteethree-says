# GPT3 Says

This project can be viewed live [here](https://gpt3says.netlify.app/)

This app uses [OpenAi's completion API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/introduction) to take whatever the user submits to generate a response. There are 4 AiEngines available and the app lets the user select which they want to use, and shows the response history in a quasi text message layout.

After each submission the prompt updates with a new placeholder text to help guide the user to a interesting response.

It was built using React Hooks and [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) for all the interaction animation.

All design and artwork was created by myself. The [Figma designs can be viewed here.](https://www.figma.com/file/LHBrJCCACLnXEPnzu3LXD3/Ask-GPT-3?node-id=0%3A1)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
